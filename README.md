# An-Efficient-Algorithm-for-Increasing-Modularity-in-IoT-Based-Automation-Systems
With the increase in complexity of devices and processes in industry and commerce, automation presents itself as a technological panacea in the form of IoT (Internet of Devices) based applications. This paper presents an adaptive, efficient and affordable system architecture through which modularity in IoT based automation can be realized. The proposed method involves an IoT based platform to coordinate, control and calibrate microcontrollers connected to various sensors and devices. Using a web page or application as an interface, the system can be configured to operate diversified workloads via distributive control and remote monitoring. The flexible nature of the system allows for a modular approach to parameter design and system integration while allowing dynamic task allocation. Data available through feedback can be used to further streamline and orient tasks in real time. This allows a single platform to multi task using an adaptive algorithm.
